##system loader
**dynamic library:**
* to genrete a dynamic library you need to system loader to resolve the undfined symbols in the executible file during runing time.
* system loader is a software component which used by operating system.

**static linking**
* in static library the undifiend symbols resolved in compilation time , and you don't need operating system to run the app.

## AVR Memory Considerations

**Memory Constraints:**

- AVR microcontrollers have limited memory, often insufficient for running a full Linux kernel , so using static library is must to run your applications.
