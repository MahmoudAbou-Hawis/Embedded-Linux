when tring to execute a file from any directory it work , because i put it in the bin files where it can found the command.


When you move an executable binary to a directory that is already included in the system's PATH, such as /bin,
 it becomes accessible from any location within the terminal.
 This behavior is due to how the PATH environment variable works.
